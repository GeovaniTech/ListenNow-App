# ListenNow App

Mobile Music Player where we can also download songs from Youtube Music. The songs are synched with my API, so if you delete the app and you download It again, you will still have your songs. And if in case you delete the songs from the device and not from the App, the songs will be synchronized again.

## Architecture

+ Kotlin
+ Fragments
+ ViewModels
+ Repository
+ Room
+ Weblient using Retrofit - Connection with [My API](https://github.com/GeovaniTech/Listennow-Api)
